### As a Student
- I want to be able to create new support/query tickets
- So that I can get help with my issues from the support team

### As a student 
- I want an edit option to edit my ticket post submission and before resolution
- so that I can convey myself better if there is a need.

### As a student
- I want the ability to delete a previously submitted ticket by me
- so that I do not hold the queue up if my query has been resolved by me already.

### As a student 
-  Before submitting my query ticket, I want the system to show if similar query tickets based on the title or content have been raised previously or are in the FAQ section 
- So that I can “+1” the relevant ticket or directly resolve it if already answered.

### As a Student,
- I want to be able to “+1” existing tickets created by other students,
- So that the support staff know how many students are facing a certain issue without creating a duplicate ticket

### As a Support Agent 
- I want the ability to sort queries based on their time of raising, the number of “+1”’s and also on the basis of reopened issues
- So that I can strategise on which queries need to be given higher priority and need quicker resolution.

### As a Support Agent
- I want to be able to mark a ticket as closed/resolved
- So that other support staff can focus on other tickets pending resolution.

### As a Student
- I want to receive email notifications within 10 minutes of when my ticket has been responded to
- So that I can be up to date on my ticket and take any steps that might be required

### As a Support Agent
- I want to send automated email notifications to the student within 10 minutes of responding to a ticket, 
- So that the students are notified when a resolution is provided in a timely manner and take any steps that might be necessary

### As a Support Agent 
- I want the ability to suggest to the admin to add certain tickets (based on my recommendation) to the FAQ section 
- So that the support team doesn’t have to answer the same queries repeatedly.
